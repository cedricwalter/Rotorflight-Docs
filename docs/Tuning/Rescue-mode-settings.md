# Rescue mode settings

On a flybarless (FBL) controller, there are typically several rescue modes designed to assist pilots in recovering their helicopters during emergencies or difficult situations. These modes are intended to quickly stabilize the helicopter and bring it back to a safe orientation. The specific modes can vary slightly depending on the model and firmware version of the VBar controller, but here are some common rescue modes you might find:

## Level Rescue Mode
When activated, the helicopter will immediately return to a level orientation, with the swashplate leveling out. This helps to prevent crashes by quickly stabilizing the helicopter.

## Altitude Rescue Mode
This mode not only levels the helicopter but also increases the collective pitch to gain altitude. This is useful in situations where the helicopter is too low or descending too quickly.

## Inverted Rescue Mode
If the helicopter is inverted when rescue is activated, this mode will flip it to an upright position before leveling it out. It ensures the helicopter is right-side-up and level.

## Beginner or Safe Mode
This mode is designed for beginners and restricts the helicopter's movement to make it easier to control. It typically limits the tilt angles and may provide self-leveling assistance.

Panic Recovery Mode
When the pilot loses control or orientation, this mode can be triggered to quickly stabilize the helicopter and prevent a crash. It usually combines features of leveling and gaining altitude.

## Stability Augmentation System (SAS)
This mode provides continuous stabilization assistance, making the helicopter more stable and easier to fly. It is often used by beginners or in training scenarios.

## 3D Rescue Mode
Tailored for 3D flight enthusiasts, this mode can quickly recover the helicopter from aggressive maneuvers and extreme orientations, ensuring it returns to a safe and stable flight position.

Each of these modes is designed to enhance safety and provide pilots with quick recovery options during flight.
