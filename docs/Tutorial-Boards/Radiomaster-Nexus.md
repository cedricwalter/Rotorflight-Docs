## Mouting

## F.Port Support
If you want to connect f.port to sbus port then you need to switch the resources from rx to tx
F.port is one wire only
You connect it to SBUS slot
Then in CLI you switch the resources

```
resource SERIAL_RX 2 NONE
resource SERIAL_TX 2 A03
```
![f-port](https://github.com/cedricwalter/Rotorflight-Docs/assets/763491/ce4b6dc5-9908-4d38-a8de-bf97ef964bee)

# FAQs

## Motors are not spooling
Does it spool if you use override? YES look at the arming flag to locate issue (https://www.rotorflight.org/docs/Tutorial-Setup/Status#arming), NO! you may need to calibrate ESC

## Throttle position is higher than the min arm position
1. Lower the throttle in your TX
2. If you can't make your throttle go lower on your TX you can increase the throttle channel value for Armin on the receiver tab


## Tips
- A, B, C are nearly identical expansion ports
- You can use the S.BUS port for ESC telemetry, if you are not using it for S.BUS or F.Port. You can use the S.BUS port for F.Port, and use the DSM port for ESC telemetry Or you can use any of the expansion ports for ESC telemetry
